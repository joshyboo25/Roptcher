# 🧠 Roptcher (For Curious Hackers)

Welcome to **Roptcher** — a tool that guesses passwords really, really fast. It’s designed to test login forms that make you type your username first, then your password (aka a 2-step login flow). Roptcher does this with style, speed, and a touch of ✨ hacker sauce ✨.

⚠️ **This tool is for educational use only. Don’t be stupid. Don’t break laws.**

## 🚀 What Does Roptcher Do?
Imagine a robot typing every possible password into a login box until it gets in. That’s Roptcher.

But it’s smarter than your average bot:
- It can run **multiple attempts at once** (multi-threaded)
- It can **pause/resume with hotkeys** like a music player (CTRL+P)
- It **grabs hidden tokens** the website needs so it doesn’t break anything
- It **saves good passwords** when it finds them

## 🔧 How to Use It
You’ll need:
- Python 3 installed
- A file full of password guesses (like `rockyou.txt`)
- A working brain 🧠

### 🖥️ Run it like this:
```bash
python Roptcherv1.1.py https://accounts.example.com/accounts/v2/login <username> wordlist.txt --threads 5
```                   

Change:
- `https://accounts.example.com/...` → to the real login link

- `<username>` → to the account you wanna test

- `wordlist.txt` → to your file of password guesses

- `--threads 3` → number of bots working at once (3 is safe) 

### Example:
```bash
python Roptcherv1.1.py https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/v2/login YouKnowWho mylist.txt --threads 3
```

## 🧠 What’s Happening Under the Hood
1. Roptcher visits the login page like a regular user
2. It base64-encodes the username so the site understands it
3. It grabs any secret tokens (like `xsrf_token`) from the cookies
4. It sends the username and each password one at a time
5. If the server lets it in → logs the hit to `hits.txt`
6. If not → tries the next one

It also saves the latest server response in `last_response.html` so you can look at what the site said back.

## 🧼 Tips to Stay Safe
- Roptcher doesn’t use proxies. **Use a VPN. Seriously.**
- **Multihop VPN = harder to trace**
- Don’t run this on accounts you don’t have permission to test. Not even once.

## 📦 What You’ll See
- ✅ = Password found
- ❌ = Incorrect guess
- 🎯 = Success message
- `hits.txt` = all the working logins
- `last_response.html` = latest response from the server
